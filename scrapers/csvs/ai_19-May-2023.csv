The sales sector is witnessing a significant transition as AI enables them to make data-driven choices and boost performance across lead generation and customer engagement. According to a report by 
McKinsey
, sales teams that use AI for lead generation and opportunity identification can increase their productivity by up to 50%.
Here are a few applications of AI in sales.
Conversation Intelligence
Conversation Intelligence (CI) uses AI to record and analyze speech and extract data-driven insights from the conversations between sales agents and customers. Businesses can use conversation intelligence to gather insightful information about customer behavior and preferences. This allows them to customize their sales strategy to fulfill client expectations.
By providing insights into human communication patterns and identifying common pain points, CI informs the design and development of 
conversational AI
 systems to meet customer needs better.
AI Avatar
AI avatars are one of the newest AI technologies causing a stir in the market. These are virtual assistants that offer individualized customer care and sales assistance using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. With the help of AI avatars, sales teams can automate repetitive operations to free up time for business-critical activities. For instance, 
Synthesia.io
 is an AI video creation platform that lets you create AI avatars for professional videos.
Lead Generation
Another area in which AI has made strides is lead generation. By using machine learning algorithms and 
predictive analytics
, businesses can effectively identify and prioritize high-quality leads based on their likelihood of conversion.
Automated lead scoring procedures can free up valuable time for sales staff, allowing them to focus on building meaningful relationships with potential clients. This way, businesses can optimize their sales efforts and improve their chances of closing deals while streamlining their lead management process.
For example, 
Leadzen.ai

AI has disrupted various industries but none like banking and 
finance
. According to a Financial Services 
report
, banks could save $447 billion by 2023 by using AI apps.
Let’s walk through some of its applications.
AI-Powered Personalized Banking
Personalized banking powered by AI is revolutionizing the industry. Machine learning algorithms integrated into mobile banking apps help customers make better financial decisions by identifying their spending patterns and offering valuable tips.
For instance, 
Tally
, a fintech company, helps customers pay off their credit card debts by offering guidance on which debts to pay first and when.
Behavior-Based Investment Predictions
Behavior-based investment predictions are investment strategies that leverage machine learning algorithms to predict market trends based on investor behavior. These strategies use a combination of financial and non-financial data, such as news articles, social media sentiment, and investor sentiment, to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future market movements.
Micro-investing apps like 
Acorns
 use AI to analyze users' spending patterns to predict when they can save or invest small amounts of money without affecting their daily expenses.
Anti-Money Laundering
With the help of AI, financial institutions can now detect fraudulent activities in real time, reducing false positives and improving the identification of suspicious transactions and behaviors. This is because AI algorithms can analyze a large amount of data and detect patterns humans may miss. For example, 
Feedzai
 is a fraud detection software that helps banks manage financial risks.
AI Adoption in Business
Getting started with AI adoption in your organization can be overwhelming. Here are three tips to get started.
Start by identifying the business problems that can benefit from AI solutions.
Assess your organization's readiness to adopt AI, including data quality, technology infrastructure, and employee skill sets.

Thought Leaders,The Controversies of AI in Advertising,https://www.unite.ai/the-controversies-of-ai-in-advertising/,2023-05-09T14:10:42-04:00,"Artificial intelligence has become part of everyday life.

AI is making waves in many industries, from construction and manufacturing to health care. Advertising is also beginning to adopt AI tools to help make better marketing decisions and campaigns.
While it has become a powerful tool, the controversial nature of AI in advertising may keep some companies from embracing it. Some concerns are valid and could change the field moving forward. 
How AI Is Changing Advertising
The rise of AI technology has given the advertising industry 
many powerful tools people can use
 to further their marketing efforts. Several programs allow AI to help organize the workflow and even automate specific tasks to make an ad campaign run smoother.
AI programs are very good at gathering and working with consumer data. Artificial intelligence can track what marketing trends and designs consumers are responding to and give suggestions to improve a campaign. 
Artificial intelligence tools can also be applied to designing and developing products such as containers and ads. AI 
makes coming up with eye-catching designs
 easy, while copywriting programs can help write advertising scripts and text. 
As technology improves, people will find more applications for AI tools in advertising. However, the controversial nature of AI in advertising throws its acceptability into question. 
AI Replacing Human Workers
One of the most significant controversies about adopting artificial intelligence in the workplace is the fear that AI tools will replace humans in certain jobs. It is a valid concern, but not as worrisome as it might initially appear. Studies have shown that, while AI has 
phased out 1.7 million jobs
 since this century began, it will also 
create 97 million more
 by 2025. 
AI and robotics might be taking on more redundant jobs from human workers, but new and more detail-oriented jobs that AI cannot do are appearing. Some involve maintaining these tools — something only humans can handle.
AI tools are becoming indispensable as advertising becomes more rooted in the digital world. However, marketing strategies will always need a human element. As social media advertising costs grow 
from $450 to $6,000 monthly
, AI tools should help human agents while controlling expenses. 
Trustworthiness of AI
Another big controversy surrounding intelligent machines is their trustworthiness. Although AI is much better at handling data than other computer programs, many people struggle to accept facts proven using it alone.
A survey conducted by the World Economic Forum found that, 
out of the 17,000 people
 surveyed, only half believed companies that use AI extensively were as trustworthy as those that don't rely on it as much.
Securing clients' trust is a big part of the advertising industry. Therefore, it is best to use AI tools in moderation. Relying too heavily on them can turn a client off to the firm's services. 
AI Predictions Can Be Wrong
While predictions and analyses from AI can be very accurate, they can also be wrong. Several factors 
go into AI calculations
. 
Inaccurate data or programming bias can affect analysis results. Therefore, relying too much on AI tools for a marketing strategy can prevent it from failing. AI should be used with marketing expertise to ensure the information is accurate and the process is sound.
Bias in Artificial Intelligence
While it's commonly believed that artificial intelligence is free of discrimination and bias, the truth is murky. AI excels in gathering and working with data, which is controlled by its programming. If the parameters are biased toward certain information, users might not get an accurate sample to work with.
Data is critical in advertising. Advertising companies must gather the right information to create a strategy the target audience will be receptive to. Therefore, it is best to combine human marketing expertise with AI tools. 
AI and Creativity
One of the most recent controversies regarding AI is the nature of originality and creativity. New AI programs such as ChatGPT and MidJourney 
have sparked debates on whether art
 and text generated by AI can be considered creative and original works. 
This is because of how the programs work. AI tools need large data sets to perform tasks, so these programs mimic art and writing styles online and analyze the works. They copy these aspects so well that artists can pinpoint which of their pieces were used. 
Because of this, artists have gone so far as to 
level lawsuits against the creators
 of these programs based on violating copyright laws. This can be a big problem for advertising companies who use these programs to generate materials.
Therefore, while these tools can help give designers ideas, they should not be the only source to design advertisements. Relying too much on 
art generator programs
 could invite a lawsuit from illustrators. 
AI Tools Complement the Human Element
AI tools in advertising will become more prolific as time goes on. However, their controversial nature can serve as a warning to avoid relying on them too much. Humans and AI working together is the future of advertising, but people must proceed with caution."

Hinton chose to step away from his role at Google, a move he detailed in a statement to the 
New York Times
, citing his growing apprehensions about the path of generative AI as a primary factor.
The British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist voiced his concerns over the potential dangers of AI chatbots, which he described as being “quite scary”. Despite the current chatbots not surpassing human intelligence, he warned that the rate of progress in the field suggests that they may soon surpass us.
Hinton's contributions to AI, particularly in the field of neural networks and deep learning, have been instrumental in shaping the landscape of modern AI systems like ChatGPT. His work enabled AI to learn from experiences similar to how humans do, a concept known as deep learning.
However, his recent statements have highlighted his growing concerns about the potential misuse of AI technologies. In an interview with the BBC, he alluded to the “nightmare scenario” of “bad actors” exploiting AI for malicious purposes, with the possibility of self-determined sub-goals emerging within autonomous AI systems.
The Double-Edged Sword
The implications of Hinton's departure from Google are profound. It serves as a stark wake-up call to the tech industry, emphasizing the urgent need for responsible technological stewardship that fully acknowledges the ethical consequences and implications of AI advancements. The rapid progress in AI presents a double-edged sword – while it has the potential to impact society significantly, it also comes with considerable risks that are yet to be fully understood.
These concerns should prompt policymakers, industry leaders, and the academic community to strive for a delicate balance between innovation and safeguarding against theoretical and emerging risks associated with AI. Hinton's statements underscore the importance of global collaboration and the prioritization of regulatory measures to avoid a potential AI arms race.
As we navigate the rapid evolution of AI, tech giants need to work together to enhance control, safety, and the ethical use of AI systems. Google's response to Hinton's departure, as articulated by their Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, reaffirms their commitment to a responsible approach towards AI, continually working to understand and manage emerging risks while pushing the boundaries of innovation.
As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, from deciding what content we consume on streaming platforms to diagnosing medical conditions, the need for thorough regulation and safety measures grows more critical. The rise of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is adding to the complexity, leading us into an era where AI can be trained to do a multitude of tasks within a set scope.
The pace at which AI is advancing has surprised even its creators, with Hinton's pioneering image analysis neural network of 2012 seeming almost primitive compared to today's sophisticated systems. Google CEO Sundar Pichai himself admitted to not fully understanding everything that their AI chatbot, Bard, can do.
It's clear that we're on a speeding train of AI progression. But as Hinton's departure reminds us, it's essential to ensure that we don't let the train build its own tracks. Instead, we must guide its path responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically."
Artificial Intelligence,Accelerating Scientific Discoveries: AI Conducts Autonomous Experiments,https://www.unite.ai/accelerating-scientific-discoveries-ai-conducts-autonomous-experiments/,2023-05-16T11:07:40-04:00,"An artificial intelligence platform known as BacterAI, designed by a research team led by a professor at the University of Michigan, has showcased its ability to conduct a staggering number of autonomous scientific experiments – as many as 10,000 per day.

The breakthrough application of AI could pave the way for rapid advancements in various fields including medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.
The results of the research were published in 
Nature Microbiology
.
Deciphering Microbial Metabolism with BacterAI
BacterAI was developed to map the metabolism of two microbes associated with oral health, without any baseline information to start with. The complex metabolic processes of bacteria involve the consumption of a specific combination of the 20 amino acids required for life. The goal of the research was to determine the precise amino acids needed by beneficial oral microbes to promote their growth.
“We know almost nothing about most of the bacteria that influence our health. Understanding how bacteria grow is the first step toward reengineering our microbiome,” said Paul Jensen, U-M assistant professor of biomedical engineering, who was at the University of Illinois when the project began.
A Challenging Task Simplified by AI
Decoding the preferred combination of amino acids for bacteria is a daunting task due to the over a million possible combinations. However, BacterAI was able to successfully determine the amino acid requirements for the growth of both 
Streptococcus gordonii
 and 
Streptococcus sanguinis
.
BacterAI's approach involved testing hundreds of combinations of amino acids per day, refining its focus and altering combinations each day based on the results of the previous day's experiments. Within a span of nine days, it achieved 90% accuracy in its predictions.
AI Learning Through Trial and Error
Unlike traditional methods that use labeled data sets to train machine-learning models, BacterAI generates its own data set through an iterative process of conducting experiments, analyzing results, and predicting future outcomes. This method enabled it to decipher the rules for feeding bacteria with fewer than 4,000 experiments.
“We wanted our AI agent to take steps and fall down, to come up with its own ideas and make mistakes. Every day, it gets a little better, a little smarter,” said Jensen, highlighting the parallels between the learning process of BacterAI and a child.
The Future of AI in Research
Given that little to no research has been conducted on approximately 90% of bacteria, conventional methods present a significant barrier in terms of time and resources required. BacterAI's ability to conduct automated experimentation could drastically accelerate discoveries. In a single day, the team managed to run up to 10,000 experiments.
However, the potential applications of BacterAI extend beyond microbiology. Researchers in any field can pose questions as puzzles for AI to solve through this kind of trial and error process.
“With the recent explosion of mainstream AI over the last several months, many people are uncertain about what it will bring in the future, both positive and negative,” said Adam Dama, a former engineer in the Jensen Lab and lead author of the study. “But to me, it's very clear that focused applications of AI like our project will accelerate everyday research.”"
Thought Leaders,"How AI, Edge Computing, IoT & The Cloud are Drastically Reshaping Vehicle Fleet Management",https://www.unite.ai/how-ai-edge-computing-iot-the-cloud-are-drastically-reshaping-vehicle-fleet-management/,2023-05-11T14:14:14-04:00,"As companies look to modernize their vehicles, the benefits of connected vehicles could make these technologies the new standard for fleet management.

In fact, 86% of connected fleet operators already surveyed have 
reported a solid return on their investment in connected fleet technology within one year
 through reduced operational costs.
Furthermore, connected fleets with advanced telematics technology today offer additional benefits in terms of managing and maintaining vehicles. 
Another study illustrated a 13% reduction in fuel costs
 for surveyed businesses, along with improvements to preventive maintenance. It also showed a 40% reduction in harsh braking, showing modifications to driving habits that could both contribute to parts longevity and improve driver safety.
Large amounts of data are difficult to process
This means vehicle fleets, insurance providers, maintenance and aftermarket companies are all looking to harness more of this intelligent telematics data. However, the amount of data produced every day keeps growing. As a result, these businesses have more data than ever at their disposal to help make informed business decisions. But, this vast amount of data brings in plenty of new challenges in capturing, digesting and analyzing the entirety of the data in a cost-effective manner.
To truly be effective and useful, data must be tracked, managed, cleansed, secured, and enriched throughout its journey to generate the right insights. Companies with automotive fleets are turning to new processing capabilities to manage and make sense of this data.
Embedded systems technology has been the norm
Traditional telematics systems have relied upon embedded systems, which are devices designed to access, collect, analyze (in-vehicle), and control data in electronic equipment, to solve a set of problems. These embedded systems have been widely used, especially in household appliances and today the technology is growing in the use of analyzing vehicle data.
Why current solutions are not very efficient
The existing solution in the market is to use the low latency of 5G. Using AI and GPU acceleration on AWS Wavelength or Azure Edge Zone, vehicle OEMs can offload onboard vehicle processors to the cloud when feasible. This approach allows traffic between 5G devices and content or application servers hosted in Wavelength zones to bypass the internet, resulting in reduced variability and content loss.
To ensure optimum accuracy and richness of datasets, and to maximize usability, sensors embedded within the vehicles are used to collect the data and transmit it wirelessly, between vehicles and a central cloud authority, in near real-time. Depending on the use cases that are increasingly becoming real-time oriented such as roadside assistance, ADAS and active driver score and vehicle score reporting, the need for lower latency and high throughput have become much larger in focus for fleets, insurers and other companies leveraging the data.
However, while 5G solves this to a large extent, the cost incurred for the volume of this data being collected and transmitted to the cloud remains cost prohibitive. This makes it imperative to identify advanced embedded compute capability inside the car for edge processing to happen as efficiently as possible.
The rise of vehicle to cloud communication
To increase the bandwidth efficiency and mitigate latency issues, it’s better to conduct the critical data processing at the edge within the vehicle and only share event-related information to the cloud. In-vehicle edge computing has become critical to ensure that connected vehicles can function at scale, due to the applications and data being closer to the source, providing a quicker turnaround and drastically improves the system’s performance.
Technological advancements have made it possible for automotive embedded systems to communicate with sensors, within the vehicle as well as the cloud server, in an effective and efficient manner. Leveraging a distributed computing environment that optimizes data exchange as well as data storage, automotive IoT improves response times and saves bandwidth for a swift data experience. Integrating this architecture with a cloud-based platform further helps to create a robust, end-to-end communications system for cost-effective business decisions and efficient operations. Collectively, the edge cloud and embedded intelligence duo connect the edge devices (sensors embedded within the vehicle) to the IT infrastructure to make way for a new range of user-centric applications based on real-world environments.
This has a wide range of applications across verticals where resulting insights can be consumed and monetized by the OEMs. The most obvious use case is for aftermarket and vehicle maintenance where effective algorithms can analyze the health of the vehicle in near real-time to suggest remedies for impending vehicle failures across vehicle assets like engine, oil, battery, tires and so on. Fleets leveraging this data can have maintenance teams ready to perform service on a vehicle that returns in a far more efficient manner since much of the diagnostic work has been performed in real time.
Additionally, insurance and extended warranties can benefit by providing active driver behavior analysis so that training modules can be drawn up specific to individual driver needs based on actual driving behavior history and analysis. For fleets, the active monitoring of both the vehicle and driver scores can enable reduced TCO (total cost of ownership) for fleet operators to reduce losses owing to pilferage, theft and negligence while again providing active training to the drivers.
Powering the future of fleet management
AI-powered analytics leveraging IoT, edge computing and the cloud are rapidly changing how fleet management is performed, making it more efficient and effective than ever. The ability of AI to analyze large amounts of information from telematics devices provides managers with valuable information to improve fleet efficiency, reduce costs and optimize productivity. From real-time analytics to driver safety management, AI is already changing the way fleets are managed.
The more datasets AI collects with OEM processing via the cloud, the better predictions it can make. This means safer, more intuitive automated vehicles in the future with more accurate routes and better real-time vehicle diagnostics."

That’s more than the combined annual output of Japan, Germany, India, and the UK, combined. Unsurprisingly it’s also what 
PwC estimates that AI will contribute to the global economy by 2030
. It’s no secret that the cost of intelligence has been falling steadily for years. In fact, in 2020, a third of enterprises reported that the 
cost of AI decreased by as much as 20% across nearly every industry
.
In 1965, Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, allowing for commensurate advancements in computing power, data storage, and algorithmic efficiency. On the heels of that prediction, the near exponential growth of the cloud and the pay-as-you-go model, now means that even smaller organizations now have access to highly scalable computing infrastructure at relatively low cost. This has removed the need for large up-front investments in computing infrastructure and has made it possible for smaller organizations to compete with larger ones on an equal footing.
Moreover, the explosion of data has played a crucial role in the reduction of the cost of intelligence. With the growth of the internet and the proliferation of sensors, there is now an abundance of data available for analysis. This has allowed 
machine learning
 algorithms to be trained on large datasets, leading to improved accuracy and performance. In addition, the open-source movement has made it possible for developers to access and use large datasets for free, lowering the barriers to entry for developing intelligent systems. Finally, advances in algorithmic efficiency have also contributed to the reduction of the cost of intelligence. Researchers have developed new techniques for training and optimizing machine learning algorithms, resulting in faster and more accurate models. This has made it possible to develop intelligent systems with fewer computational resources, reducing the cost of development and deployment.
In an era where AI and ML technologies are ubiquitous, we can expect to see significant changes in how enterprises operate and innovate across industries. In fintech, for example, agile startups are using AI to deliver everything from STP for customer KYC and on-boarding to financial and budgetary insights. And in healthcare, it’s enabling small tech start-ups to predict patient symptoms via inputs from wearables, and deliver timely emergency services.
Building A Connected Enterprise Is Critical
Connected enterprises are much better positioned to take advantage of the falling cost of intelligence than their traditional counterparts. Part of the reason is that connected enterprises use digital technology to connect with customers, employees, suppliers, and partners in real-time. They also take a cloud-first approach to infrastructure, helping them easily process high volumes of data from mobile devices, social media, and other tools to streamline processes and gain insights into customer behavior. Most connected enterprises in fact, are built on three major pillars.
Amplified Human Potential:
 Often, connected enterprises play host to culture of innovation, agility and collaboration. The high degree of automation and end-to-end digitalization means that employees are emancipated from the tyranny of repetitive manual tasks, and have more time for creative problem-solving and higher order work. In fact, having the digital infrastructure to support innovation culture is just as important as building the culture itself.
Value Networks:
 Leaders within connected enterprises understand that the linear supply chain has outlived its usefulness, and are instead investing in ecosystems of technology providers, aggregators, distributors, and startups. Low-latency connections within these ecosystems, or value networks, means that every stakeholder has access to a stream of real-time information to fuel decision-making, optimize processes, and accelerate product delivery. A solid example lies in how auto insurers have partnered with manufactures and telematics companies to launch pay-as-you-drive models, where policyholders are charged a lower premium if they consistently exhibit safe driving behaviour. At the same time, the information collected by the onboard telematics helps emergency responders quickly track the scene of an accident, while feeding critical data back to manufacturers so they can optimize safety components.
Cognitive Operations:
 In today’s age, a ‘culture of innovation’ is only as good as the data that feeds it. Connected enterprises are more decentralized and flexible that traditional organizations, with distributed teams and a focus on results rather than process. Agile methodologies, AI-driven processes that require very little human intervention, and a high-degree of internal connectivity are hallmarks of successful connected enterprises. This means that data flows seamlessly across the entire system, and stakeholders can instantly access information that is critical to their work without the bottlenecks that siloed operations often create.
What Does The Real-World Impact Entail?
With a presence in over 20 countries across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, a fast-growing FMCG company was looking to cement its position across multiple geographies. However, despite its success, the company struggled to tap into its full regional sales potential due to the fragmented retail landscape in emerging markets. Specifically, the company found it challenging to gain visibility into demand and increase its market share, due to a heavy reliance on manual processes. In terms of a solution,  using an AI-powered platform to automate operations and map out critical operational data was the first step. The next involved creating a dashboard for their sales representatives and territory managers that helped them map geo-penetration, identify territory gaps, and build a strategy for effective outlet coverage. In just a few months, they saw a 15% increase in value per size, 15% improvement in sales rep productivity, and a 50% jump in ECO.
Similarly, when the pandemic was in full swing, a CPG company tracked the spread of COVID across different neighbourhoods, and fed that information into an AI platform to predict which retail locations would be hit hardest by stock-outs. By using these insights, coupled with a digitally connected distributor network, they were able to restock their products in a matter of a couple of days, while shelves lay bare of competitor brands.
The Ethics And Agility Of Intelligence
These stories illustrate how small organizations that embrace the AI tools and talents available to them, are able to create an impact that larger, more traditional enterprises would struggle to replicate. To stay resilient in a world where every organization has access to cutting-edge intelligence and analysis tools, turning into a connected enterprise is clearly essential.
But besides creating more economic value,  a clear opportunity for enterprises to stand out amongst their peers is to commit to the ethical use of AI. Not only does this translate into using the technology to further environmental and social agendas, but it means ensuring that their AI models are culturally sensitive, unbiased toward minority perspectives, and are used in compliance with privacy regulations. As AI becomes further entrenched into enterprise operations, workforce displacement is also a key concern – one that leaders can address via upskilling programs and effective change management."

Google Keynote (Google I/O ‘23)
Watch this video on YouTube
The Evolution of Google Bard
Debuted in February, Bard marked Google's innovative foray into AI-based conversational chatbots, akin to OpenAI’s renowned ChatGPT. Bard was initially equipped with a scaled-down version of Google’s Language Model for Dialogue Applications, LaMDA. This AI chatbot was designed to interact with users in a human-like manner, engaging in conversation, generating ideas, writing essays and codes, and even tackling math problems.
However, the initial version of Bard received criticism for its limited capabilities and factual inaccuracies. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, acknowledged these limitations, revealing that they were intentional and part of the plan to progressively enhance Bard's capabilities with more potent LLMs.
Fast forward to Google I/O 2023, Google delivered on its promise by upgrading Bard with the latest version of the Parallel Language Model, PaLM 2. This move marks a significant leap from LaMDA, amplifying Bard's capabilities.
Initially, Bard was accessible exclusively to a select group of trusted testers in the US and the UK. Although the waitlist opened in March 2023, Bard remained inaccessible to the general public. However, Google has now broadened Bard's availability to over 180 countries and territories. While currently available only in English, Google plans to extend Bard's language support to Japanese and Korean, followed by an additional 40 languages in the future.
Exploring Bard's Enhanced Capabilities
With the integration of PaLM 2, Bard's functionality has experienced considerable improvements. The chatbot now boasts superior math, logic, and reasoning skills. It's capable of generating, explaining, and debugging code in over 20 programming languages, aiding developers in their programming endeavors.
Bard's latest version also brings forth a more visual and interactive user experience. Users can now provide image inputs to Bard, who can then respond with relevant information, leveraging Google tools like Google Lens. Moreover, Bard can generate humorous captions, further enhancing user engagement.
Not only can Bard's responses be directly exported to Gmail and Google Docs, but the chatbot also has the ability to browse the web for images, tap into knowledge graphs for relevant information, and utilize Google Maps for location-related queries. The integration with Google Sheets further augments its utility.
In a bid to expand its collaborative functionalities, Google plans to integrate Bard with external services such as Adobe Firefly. This integration will allow users to generate new images from text prompts and bring them to the editing table. Google is also establishing connections between Bard and other partners like Kayak, OpenTable, ZipRecruiter, Instacart, Wolfram, and Khan Academy.
Bard vs ChatGPT: The New AI Rivalry
With the announcement of the upgraded Bard chatbot, Google is posed to challenge the dominance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. One of Google’s strategic moves was the introduction of a lightweight version called “Gecko,” designed for smartphone integration, enabling users to run it locally on their Android devices. Besides Gecko, there are other more potent versions, including Otter, Bison, and Unicorn.
In a head-to-head comparison between Bard and ChatGPT, both AI chatbots display impressive capabilities. However, certain distinguishing factors could tip the scales in Bard's favor. When it came to translating complex phrases, Bard provides more context, enhancing the comprehensibility of the translations.
Bard also outperforms ChatGPT in the realm of coding. With its support for over 20 programming languages, Bard can assist professionals with code generation, explanation, and debugging, and it does so with a faster response time compared to ChatGPT.
Another advantage Bard holds over ChatGPT is its connectivity to the internet. For example, when asked about the differences between OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s PaLM2, Bard can provide an up-to-date response, while ChatGPT is limited to information from before 2021.
Despite these advantages, Bard has a few limitations. One notable drawback is the lack of source backing for the information it provides, which can potentially lead to the spread of false information. Additionally, unlike ChatGPT, Bard doesn't allow access to previous interactions.
As Google continues to refine and expand Bard's capabilities, it becomes increasingly clear that Bard is set to become a major competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The advancements in AI chatbots, as exemplified by Google's Bard, are a testament to the vast potential of AI in enhancing user experience and interaction.
The Future of Chatbots
ChatGPT, with its early mover advantage, has become a household name in tech and has a dedicated user base accustomed to its functionalities. However, with Bard being offered for free compared to the GPT4-powered version of ChatGPT priced at $20 a month, Google's chatbot has a competitive edge.
Both OpenAI and Google are working on enhancing their chatbots, with plans to make them multimodal and compatible with plugins. As the AI chatbot industry evolves, tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta are in a heated race to provide the most innovative and powerful offerings.
Although OpenAI’s ChatGPT had a head start with its launch in September 2022, Google is rapidly closing the gap. With its strategic improvements and expansive global reach, Bard is emerging as a significant threat to the dominance of ChatGPT."

As these technologies become ever more integrated into our daily lives, it has become increasingly crucial for governments, corporations, and society at large to grapple with the implications and potential consequences of this unprecedented technological revolution.
One of the most pressing issues at the heart of this conversation is the regulation of AI. Historically, the tech industry has typically resisted government regulation, advocating for a more laissez-faire approach. The rationale is often that the pace of technological innovation would be hindered by cumbersome regulatory frameworks, or that governments, lacking the necessary technical expertise, could enact misguided regulations that do more harm than good.
However, a potential shift in this mindset was witnessed when Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, a leading organization in the field of artificial intelligence, testified before a Senate subcommittee on May 16. The hearing was a part of the broader Congressional effort to understand the potential societal impacts of AI, and to consider possible legislative responses to mitigate any negative consequences.
Altman's testimony was groundbreaking in several ways. It represented a departure from the traditional tech industry's stance towards regulation, with Altman making a compelling case for why proactive, government-led regulation of AI is not only necessary but also desirable. Furthermore, the testimony provided lawmakers with valuable insights into the potential risks and rewards of AI, as well as tangible proposals for how to navigate this complex terrain.
Let's look at some of the key takeaways from Sam Altman's landmark testimony:
1. The Call for AI Regulation
Altman's plea for regulation of AI technology stands as a stark contrast to the defensive stance usually adopted by tech industry leaders when confronted with the prospect of regulation. His insistence that “if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong” underlines the potential risks associated with unregulated AI. This represents a major shift in the tech industry’s approach towards regulation, suggesting a new willingness to work with government bodies to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of AI technologies.
2. Mitigating Economic Impact
In his testimony, Altman acknowledged that AI technology could displace certain jobs, but he also suggested it could create new ones. The challenge, he believes, lies with the government's ability to effectively manage this economic shift. This places a spotlight on the importance of government policy in managing the impact of AI on the economy, reiterating the need for public and private sector collaboration.
3. Proposal of an AI Regulatory Agency
Altman proposed the establishment of a regulatory agency dedicated to overseeing the development and deployment of large-scale AI models. He suggested that such an agency could develop safety regulations and create mandatory tests that AI models must pass before being released to the public. This proposal underscores the need for proactive measures to ensure AI safety, rather than a reactive approach.
4. Recognizing AI as a Tool
Despite his calls for regulation, Altman made it clear that AI is, at its core, a tool—one that can be used for various purposes depending on its application. He aligned with IBM's chief privacy and trust officer, Christina Montgomery, in suggesting that regulation should be focused on specific uses rather than the technology itself.
5. Advocating for a New Approach
Altman emphasized that the approach to AI regulation should be different from the approach to social media regulation. His argument for a “totally new approach” reflects the unique challenges posed by AI technology, and the inadequacy of existing regulatory frameworks to address these challenges.
Sam Altman's testimony to Congress marked a significant turning point in the conversation around AI regulation. His call for proactive regulation, collaboration between tech companies and government, and the creation of a dedicated AI regulatory agency points towards a new era where the tech industry and government work in tandem to navigate the unprecedented challenges and opportunities posed by AI. As AI continues to evolve, the implications of Altman's testimony will become increasingly pertinent.

Artificial Intelligence,Can You Build Large Language Models Like ChatGPT At Half Cost?,https://www.unite.ai/can-you-build-large-language-models-like-chatgpt-at-half-cost/,2023-05-11T03:24:58-04:00,Learn about the cost of training Large Language Models like GPT-3. Explore how the LiGO technique can halve the cost of training LLMs.,"Large Language Models
 (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have revolutionized AI by offering Natural Language Understanding and content generation capabilities. But their development comes at a hefty price limiting accessibility and further research. Researchers estimate that training GPT-3 cost OpenAI around 
$5 million
. Nevertheless, Microsoft recognized the potential and invested 
$1 billion
 in 2019 and 
$10 billion
 in 2023 in OpenAI’s GPT-3 and ChatGPT venture.
LLMs are 
machine learning
 models trained on extensive textual data for NLP applications. They are based on transformer architecture and utilize attention mechanisms for NLP tasks like question-answering, machine translation, sentiment analysis, etc.
The question arises: can the efficiency of these large models be increased while simultaneously reducing computational cost and training time?
Several approaches, like 
Progressive Neural Networks
, 
Network Morphism
, 
intra-layer model parallelism
, 
knowledge inheritance
, etc., have been developed to reduce the computational cost of training neural networks. The novel 
LiGO
 (Linear Growth Operator) approach we will discuss is setting a new benchmark. It halves the computational cost of training LLMs.
Before discussing this technique, examining the factors contributing to the high price of making LLMs is essential.
Cost of Building Large Language Models
Three major expenses for developing LLMs are as follows:
1. Computational Resources
Building LLMs require massive computational resources to train on large datasets. They must process billions of parameters and learn complex patterns from massive textual data.
Investment in specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (
GPUs
) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) is required for building and training LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
For instance, GPT-3 was trained on a 
supercomputer
 with 10000 enterprise-grade GPUs (H100 and A100) and 285,000 CPU cores.
2. Energy Consumption
The intensive computational resources required for building LLMs result in significant energy consumption. For instance, training 175 billion parameters GPT-3 took 
14.8 days
 using 10,000 V100 GPUs, equivalent to 3.55 million GPU hours. Such a high level of energy consumption has significant environmental effects as well.
3. Data Storage & Management
LLMs are trained on large datasets. For instance, GPT-3 was trained on a vast corpus of textual 
data
, including Common Crawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2, and Wikipedia, among other sources. Significant infrastructure investment is required to collect, curate and store these datasets.
Also, cloud storage is required for data storage, and human expertise for data preprocessing and version control. Moreover, ensuring that your data strategy complies with regulations like GDPR also adds to the cost.
LiGO Technique: Reduce the Cost of Building Large Language Models to Half
LiGO (Linear Growth Operator) is a novel technique developed by researchers at MIT to reduce the computational cost of training LLMs by 50%. The method involves initializing the weights of larger models from those of smaller pre-trained models, enabling efficient scaling of neural networks.
Image from the Paper: 
Learning to Grow Pretrained Models For Efficient Transformer Training
Yoon Kim
, the senior author of the paper, says:
“It’s been estimated that training models at the scale of what ChatGPT is hypothesized to run on could take millions of dollars just for a single training run. Can we improve the efficiency of these training methods, so we can still get good models in less time and for less money? We propose to do this by leveraging smaller language models that have previously been trained.”
This method maintains the performance benefits of larger models with reduced computational cost and training time compared to training a large model from scratch. LiGO utilizes a data-driven linear growth operator that combines depth and width operators for optimum performance.
The paper utilized various datasets to conduct text-based experiments, including the English Wikipedia corpus for training BERT and RoBERTa models and the C4 dataset for training GPT2.
The LiGO technique experimentation included growing BERT-Small to BERT-Base, BERT-Base to BERT-Large, RoBERTaSmall to RoBERTa-Base, GPT2-Base to GPT2-Medium, and CaiT-XS to CaiT-S.
The researchers compared their approach with several other baselines, including training from scratch, progressive training, bert2BERT, and KI.
LiGO technique offered 44.7% savings in FLOPs (floating-point operations per second) and 40.7% savings in wall time compared to training BERT-Base from scratch by reusing the BERT-Small model. LiGO growth operator outperforms StackBERT, MSLT, bert2BERT, and KI in efficient training.
Benefits of Using a Training Optimization Technique Like LiGO
LiGO is an efficient neural network training method that has various benefits listed as follows:
1. Faster Training
As stated earlier, faster training is the main advantage of the LiGO technique. It trains LLMs in half the time, increasing productivity and reducing costs.
2. Resource Efficient
LiGO is resource-efficient since it minimizes wall time and FLOPs, leading to a more cost-effective and eco-friendly approach to training large transformer models.
3. Generalization
The LiGO technique has improved the performance of both language and vision transformers suggesting that it is a generalizable technique that can be applied to various tasks.
Building commercial AI products is just one facet of the overall expenses associated with AI systems. Another significant component of costs comes from daily operations. For instance, it costs OpenAI about 
$700,000
 every day to answer queries using ChatGPT. Researchers are expected to continue exploring approaches that make LLMs cost-effective during training and more accessible on runtime.

it broke records
 as the fastest-growing consumer application in history, with 100 million users. For perspective, it took TikTok 
nine months
 and Instagram 
2.5 years
 to reach that milestone.
Since its release, generative AI has been building to a fever pitch in nearly every sector, including finance. 
BloombergGPT
 was announced in late March, and its capabilities include sentiment analysis, risk assessment, fraud detection and document classification, along with other financial NLP tasks.
Now that Pandora's box has been opened, there's no going back. We will see generative AI and LLMs take a more significant role in the financial sector, likely leading to investment experts shifting into new positions emphasizing prompt engineering and contextual analysis.
Since the change is inevitable, the logical next step is to debug the system, so to speak, by looking at the potential risks and considering ways to mitigate them.

Currently, the financial markets are experiencing 
serious swings
 that are leaving all but the most iron-stomached investors feeling motion sickness. Now let's consider what could happen if we add a substantial cohort of financial advisors who are heavily reliant on AI to give investment advice.
It's true that we all know AI is prone to bias; we also know that human nature makes us far more likely to put too much trust in machines, especially ones that appear highly intelligent. This bias – called “
machine heuristic
” – could all too easily spiral out of control if professionals start relying too heavily on AI predictions and not checking the outputs against their own knowledge and experience.
The current iteration of ChatGPT essentially agrees with anything you say, so if people start asking ChatGPT about financial markets based on unclear, partial or false information, they’ll get answers that confirm their ideas, even if they’re wrong. It’s easy to see how this could lead to disaster, especially when human biases or a bit of lazy fact-checking are added to the mix.
Reward: Enhanced Efficiency, Productivity, Risk Management and Customer Satisfaction
Hedge funds like 
Citadel
 and banking monoliths like 
Morgan Stanley
 are already embracing this technology as a knowledge resource because it’s so skilled at completing routine tasks like data organization and risk assessment. When incorporated as a tool in an investment professionals toolbox, it can help financial managers make better decisions in less time, freeing them up to do the expertise-driven parts of the job they enjoy most.
It’s also able to 
analyze financial data in real time
, identify fraudulent transactions and take immediate action to prevent losses. Detecting these fraud patterns would be difficult or impossible to spot with traditional methods. Financial institutions in the U.S. alone lost over 
$4.5 billion
 to fraud in 2022, so this is a huge reward for banks.
Additionally, generative AI allows for smarter virtual assistants to provide personalized and efficient customer service 24/7. For instance, India’s 
Tata Mutual Fund
 partnered with conversational AI platform Haptik to create a chatbot to help customers with basic account queries and provide financial advice, leading to a 70% drop in call volume and better customer satisfaction.
Risk: Insufficient Compliance Regulations
It's hard to imagine, but GPT's incredible power is still in relative infancy. The future will undoubtedly see an iteration so sophisticated that we can't yet fully grasp its abilities. Because of this, the global community must establish strict, comprehensive regulatory frameworks that ensure its fair, ethical use. Otherwise, it is likely that we will see 
discriminatory practices
 arise as a result of biased data, whether intentional or unintentional.
Right now, consistent controls are sorely lacking, leaving companies and countries scrambling to decide how to handle this technology and how tight their restrictions should be. For instance, in sectors that deal with highly sensitive data, such as finance, healthcare and government, many organizations have outright 
banned any use of ChatGPT
 because they don't know how secure their data will be. Amazon, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, Accenture and Goldman Sachs are all examples of this 
sweeping ban
.
On a larger scale, countries are in the same regulatory limbo, with some, like 
Germany
 and 
Italy
, issuing temporary bans until they can ensure it will not incite GDPR violations. This is a serious concern for all EU members, especially in the wake of known 
data leaks
 already reported by OpenAI.
Unfortunately, regulators are already pretty far behind the curve when it comes to developing solid legal frameworks for this tech. Still, once they catch up, we can expect to see GPT take its place in every sector of the global community.
Reward: Better Regulation Means Faster Adoption
The lack of controls on GPT tech is a major bottleneck for more widespread adoption. Yes, it's a trendy novelty right now, but it can't be viewed as a serious part of any long-term corporate strategy without comprehensive rules and guidelines about its use.
Once the global community has developed and implemented appropriate frameworks, businesses will feel more comfortable investing in this technology, opening up a whole new wave of use cases across even the most cybersecurity-forward sectors like healthcare and government.
Risk: Flooding Finance Markets With Amateurs
Earlier, I mentioned the problem of generative AI only being able to give outputs based on its inputs. This problem has broader implications than allowing seasoned professionals to be a bit lazy. At least the industry veterans have the background and skills necessary to contextualize the data they're given, which is more than can be said for the amateurs who think they can masquerade as professional advisors by learning how to use ChatGPT.
There's nothing wrong with being a DIY investor, especially if you enjoy exploring financial markets and experimenting with risk at your own expense. The problem is when these relatively unskilled people with a bit of spare cash and a lot of free time decide they're more competent than they really are because of AI and decide to brand themselves as professionals. Their lack of real-world experience and formal training will likely cause a fair amount of short-term chaos and put extra stress on actual professionals.
Reward: ChatGPT Can Give Professionals a Long-Term Reputation Boost and Democratize Financial Advice
The good news here is that if the real veterans can weather the inconvenience of a temporarily flooded market, they'll see how fast people get tired of hearing 
generic advice
 they could have read on Yahoo Finance and watch the amateurs drop out of the market as fast as they entered, leaving only the seasoned advisors to pick up the now-advisorless clients wishing to pay for expert help from someone who can deliver real results.
On the other side of the equation, ChatGPT can also play a role in closing the financial literacy gap and helping those without access to a professional advisor learn some basic strategies for optimizing their money. Its ability to generate useful, basic investment advice means it is now possible to start making financial education more accessible, even to those who have been previously unable to pay for professional financial services.
Lowering the barriers to better financial stability is an extremely important benefit of this technology because, currently, only 
one in three adults
 in the global community are financially literate."

 a news aggregator app, he is also an AI ethics, and tech policy expert.  SmartNews uses AI and a human editorial team as it aggregates news for readers.
You were instrumental in helping to Establish Google's Trust & Safety Asia Pacific hub in Singapore, what were some key lessons that you learned from this experience?
When building Trust and Safety teams country-level expertise is critical because abuse is very different based on the country you’re regulating. For example, the way Google products were abused in Japan was different than how they were abused in Southeast Asia and India. This means abuse vectors are very different depending on who's abusing, and what country you're based in; so there's no homogeneity. This was something we learned early.
I also learned that cultural diversity is incredibly important when building Trust and Safety teams abroad. At Google, we ensured there was enough cultural diversity and understanding within the people we hired. We were looking for people with specific domain expertise, but also for language and market expertise.
I also found cultural immersion to be incredibly important. When we’re building Trust and Safety teams across borders, we needed to ensure our engineering and business teams could immerse themselves. This helps ensure everyone is closer to the issues we were trying to manage.  To do this, we did quarterly immersion sessions with key personnel, and that helped raise everyone’s cultural IQs.
Finally, cross-cultural comprehension was so important. I managed a team in Japan, Australia, India, and Southeast Asia, and the way in which they interacted was wildly different. As a leader, you want to ensure everyone can find their voice. Ultimately, this is all designed to build a high-performance team that can execute sensitive tasks like Trust and Safety.
Previously, you were also on the Trust & Safety team with ByteDance for the TikTok application, how are videos that are often shorter than one minute monitored effectively for safety?
I want to reframe this question a bit, because it doesn’t really matter whether a video is short or long form. That isn’t a factor when we evaluate video safety, and length doesn’t have real weight on whether a video can spread abuse.
When I think of abuse, I think of abuse as “issues.” What are some of the issues users are vulnerable to? Misinformation? Disinformation? Whether that video is 1 minute or 1 hour, there is still misinformation being shared and the level of abuse remains comparable.
Depending on the issue type, you start to think through policy enforcement and safety guardrails and how you can protect vulnerable users. As an example, let's say there's a video of someone committing self-harm. When we receive notification this video exists, one must act with urgency, because someone could lose a life. We depend a lot on 
machine learning
 to do this type of detection. The first move is to always contact authorities to try and save that life, nothing is more important. From there, we aim to suspend the video, livestream, or whatever format in which it is being shared. We need to ensure we’re minimizing exposure to that kind of harmful content ASAP.
Likewise, if it's hate speech, there are different ways to unpack that. Or in the case of bullying and harassment, it really depends on the issue type, and depending on that, we'd tweak our enforcement options and safety guardrails. Another example of a good safety guardrail was that we implemented machine learning that could detect when someone writes something inappropriate in the comments and provide a prompt to make them think twice before posting that comment. We wouldn’t stop them necessarily, but our hope was that people would think twice before sharing something mean.
It comes down to a combination of machine learning and keyword rules. But, when it comes to livestreams, we also had human moderators reviewing those streams  that were flagged by AI so they could report immediately and implement protocols. Because they’re happening in real time, it’s not enough to rely on users to report, so we need to have humans monitoring in real-time.
Since 2021, you’ve been the Head of Trust, Safety, and Customer experience at SmartNews, a news aggregator app. Could you discuss how SmartNews leverages machine learning and natural language processing to identify and prioritize high-quality news content?
The central concept is that we have certain “rules” or machine learning technology that can parse an article or advertisement and understand what that article is about.
Whenever there is something that violates our “rules”, let's say something is factually incorrect or misleading, we have machine learning flag that content to a human reviewer on our editorial team. At that stage, a they understand our editorial values and can quickly review the article and make a judgement about its appropriateness or quality. From there, actions are taken to address it.
How does SmartNews use AI to ensure the platform is safe, inclusive, and objective?
SmartNews was founded on the premise that hyper-personalization is good for the ego but is also polarizing us all by reinforcing biases and putting people in a filter bubble.
The way in which SmartNews uses AI is a little different because we’re not exclusively optimizing for engagement. Our algorithm wants to understand you, but it's not necessarily hyper-personalizing to your taste. That’s because we believe in broadening perspectives. Our AI engine will introduce you to concepts and articles beyond adjacent concepts.
The idea is that there are things people need to know in the public interest, and there are things people need to know to broaden their scope. The balance we try to strike is to provide these contextual analyses without being big-brotherly. Sometimes people won’t like the things our algorithm puts in their feed. When that happens, people can choose to not read that article. However, we are proud of the AI engine’s ability to promote serendipity, curiosity, whatever you want to call it.
On the safety side of things, SmartNews has something called a “Publisher Score,” this is an algorithm designed to constantly evaluate whether a publisher is safe or not. Ultimately, we want to establish whether a publisher has an authoritative voice. As an example, we can all collectively agree ESPN is an authority on sports. But, if you’re a random blog copying ESPN content, we need to ensure that ESPN is ranking higher than that random blog. The publisher score also considers factors like originality, when articles were posted, what user reviews look like, etc. It’s ultimately a spectrum of many factors we consider.
One thing that trumps everything is “What does a user want to read?” If a user wants to view clickbait articles, we won't stop them if it isn't illegal or breaks our guidelines. We don't impose on the user, but if something is unsafe or inappropriate, we have our due diligence before something hits the feed.
What are your views on journalists using generative AI to assist them with producing content?
I believe this question is an ethical one, and something we’re currently debating here at SmartNews. How should SmartNews view publishers submitting content formed by generative AI instead of journalists writing it up?
I believe that train has officially left the station. Today, journalists are using AI to augment their writing. It's a function of scale, we don't have the time in the world to produce articles at a commercially viable rate, especially as news organizations continue to cut staff. The question then becomes, how much creativity goes into this? Is the article polished by the journalist? Or is the journalist completely reliant?
At this juncture, generative AI is not able to write articles on breaking news events because there's no training data for it. However, it can still give you a pretty good generic template to do so. As an example, school shootings are so common, we could assume that generative AI could give a journalist a prompt on school shootings and a journalist could insert the school that was affected to receive a complete template.
From my standpoint working with SmartNews, there are two principles I think are worth considering. Firstly, we want publishers to be up front in telling us when content was generated by AI, and we want to label it as such. This way when people are reading the article, they're not misled about who wrote the article. This is transparency at the highest order.
Secondly, we want that article to be factually correct. We know that generative AI tends to make things up when it wants, and any article written by generative AI needs to be proofread by a journalist or editorial staff.
You’ve previously argued for tech platforms to unite and create common standards to fight digital toxicity, how important of an issue is this?
I believe this issue is of critical importance, not just for companies to operate ethically, but to maintain a level of dignity and civility. In my opinion, platforms should come together and develop certain standards to maintain this humanity. As an example, no one should ever be encouraged to take their own life, but in some situations, we find this type of abuse on platforms, and I believe that is something companies should come together to protect against.
Ultimately, when it comes to problems of humanity, there shouldn't be competition. There shouldn’t even necessarily be competition on who is the cleanest or safest community—we should all aim to ensure our users feel safe and understood. Let’s compete on features, not exploitation.
What are some ways that digital companies can work together?
Companies should come together when there are shared values and the possibility of collaboration. There are always spaces where there is intersectionality across companies and industries, especially when it comes to fighting abuse, ensuring civility in platforms, or reducing polarization. These are moments when companies should be working together.
There is of course a commercial angle with competition, and typically competition is good. It helps ensure strength and differentiation across companies and delivers solutions with a level of efficacy monopolies cannot guarantee.
But, when it comes to protecting users, or promoting civility, or reducing abuse vectors, these are topics which are core to us preserving the free world. These are things we need to do to ensure we protect what is sacred to us, and our humanity. In my opinion, all platforms have a responsibility to collaborate in defense of human values and the values that make us a free world.
What are your current views on responsible AI?
We're at the beginning of something very pervasive in our lives. This next phase of generative AI is a problem that we don’t fully understand, or can only partially comprehend at this juncture.
When it comes to responsible AI, it’s so incredibly important that we develop strong guardrails, or else we may end up with a Frankenstein monster of Generative AI technologies. We need to spend the time thinking through everything that could go wrong. Whether that is bias creeping into the algorithms, or large language models themselves being used by the wrong people to do nefarious acts.
The technology itself isn’t good or bad, but it can be used by bad people to do bad things. This is why investing the time and resources in AI ethicists to do adversarial testing to understand the design faults is so critical. This will help us understand how to prevent abuse, and I think that’s probably the most important aspect of responsible AI.
Because AI can’t yet think for itself, we need smart people who can build these defaults when AI is being programmed. The important aspect to consider right now is timing – we need these positive actors doing these things NOW before it’s too late.
Unlike other systems we’ve designed and built in the past, AI is different because it can iterate and learn on its own, so if you don’t set up strong guardrails on what and how it’s learning, we cannot control what it might become.
Right now, we’re seeing some big companies laying off ethics boards and responsible AI teams as part of major layoffs. It remains to be seen how seriously these tech majors are taking the technology and how seriously they’re reviewing the potential downfalls of AI in their decision making.
Is there anything else that you would like to share about your work with Smartnews?
I joined SmartNews  because I believe in its mission, the mission has a certain purity to it. I strongly believe the world is becoming more polarized, and there isn't enough media literacy today to help combat that trend.
Unfortunately, there are too many people who take WhatsApp messages as gospel and believe them at face value. That can lead to tremendous consequences, including—and especially—violence. This all boils down to people not understanding what they can and cannot believe.
If we do not educate people, or inform them on how to make decisions on the trustworthiness of what they’re consuming. If we do not introduce media literacy levels to discern between news and fake news, we'll continue to advocate the problem and increase the issues history has taught us not to do.
One of the most important components of my work at SmartNews is to help reduce polarization in the world. I want to fulfill the founder's mission to improve media literacy where they can understand what they're consuming and make informed opinions about the world and the many diverse perspectives.
